## Integrate BigQuery into GTM SS - A void waiting to be filled

### Chaos - The Inifinite Sink of Data

## Integrate Pub/Sub into GTM SS - A message from the Gods

`getGoogleAuth`

## Integrate Google Sheets into GTM SS - Access to God-like knowledge

### Apollo - The (complex) God of Wisdom

Accessing complex data structures in Google Sheets

## Integrate Predictive Analytics & GenAI into GTM SS - An oracle at your disposal

### Phoebe - The Goddess of Prophecy

### Dioscuri - The Greek name for Gemini (are we running out of good names?)

## Conclusion

New APIs (e.g. Promises, getGoogleAuth, etc) unlock new use cases

While nothing of this is completely new, the sGTM Pantheon solutions are help making the integration of first-party data into sGTM more accessible and easier to implement. The Pantheon solutions are designed to work seamlessly with sGTM, allowing businesses to leverage the power of GCP services to enhance their data collection, analysis, and activation capabilities. By combining the strengths of sGTM with the flexibility of Firestore, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Google Sheets, and Predictive Analytics & GenAI, companies can create a data ecosystem that drives better decision-making, personalization, and performance.

As you might have noticed, I couldn't withstand the temptation to use the Greek mythology theme for this blog post. I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

Until next time, happy tracking!

This article is a write-up of my talk at MeasureCamp Czechia in Prague in September 2023 - thanks to everyone who attended the session and provided feedback.

I'll explore how Google Analytics 4 (GA4) can be used as a lightweight Customer Data Platform (CDP) and how it can be integrated with other tools to create a powerful data activation stack. Furthermore, I'll also discuss the current state of GA4 and the challenges faced by GA4 users. Lastly, I'll highlight some of the recently added powerful GA4 features like the Audience Export API and User data exports to BigQuery and how they can be used to build a use case-specific data activation stack (or "Customer Data Platform (CDP)" if we want to join the buzzword bingo).

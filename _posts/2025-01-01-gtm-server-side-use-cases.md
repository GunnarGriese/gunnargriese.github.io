Introduction

“What are your main use cases for GTM Server-Side?” This question (or a variation of it) is one I find myself asking again and again when entering engagements with clients’ analytics and/or marketing responsibles that have adopted GTM Server-Side (sGTM) in the past. 

Most often though, I find the answers to this question slightly underwhelming. They tend to range from “We simply want to collect more data by bypassing ad blockers and browsers’ tracking prevention.” over “We want to make our measurement setup more compliant.” to “We don’t have a use case, but everybody else seems to be doing it - so, we did as well.”

Don’t get me wrong, the above answers - well, at least the first two - make sense from a business perspective. Investing into the compliance of your setup is an insurance that helps prevent larger harm due to potential fines should your setup ever come under scrutiny by the respective authorities. So, it appears to be a wise business decision to hedge your risks here.

In theory, having more data about your users and being able to better understand which actions they take, where your website’s user experience doesn’t live up to expectations, etc. can help you optimize your online presence even better. Signaling more conversion events back to your marketing vendors’ platforms will most likely yield a positive effect on your marketing performance and result in cost savings or even help contribute more revenue. Again, a decision maker in the field of digital marketing in this age of hard-to-get marketing budgets would be wise to seize this opportunity.

And to be absolutely clear, at the same time I don’t believe that every company should adopt sGTM. 

But still, having these measures in place is no longer a competitive advantage as we see entry barriers being lowered to deploy these technical solutions (there’s tons of templates and solution guides out there) and the associated costs with maintaining these solutions are going down as well (you can run a sGTM for 20 bucks / month or less these days). The trend is clear: the adoption rate of sGTM in companies will keep on increasing and with it your business’ competitive advantage will shrink.

To say it more bluntly, should you and your team have decided to go down the sGTM route, having the above in place is simply the first step of a longer journey during which you’ll be able to reap the benefits of your efforts. 

Or differently put - The initial question above is usually followed by this one:
“Are you and your team leveraging the full potential of GTM Server-Side?”

Let’s find out the answer to this (even more important) question together in this blog post by gaining a basic understanding of sGTM, applying it to common challenges in digital marketing, and thereby arriving at use cases that help you drive profit.
What is GTM Server-Side?

Mainly a big cost.

Creativity will bring you a competitive advantage. Even the use cases in this blog post will become the new standard sooner or later.

Ironically enough, this trend has mainly resulted in companies focusing on collecting more user data by circumventing ad blockers and browsers' tracking prevention mechanisms.
My question is: Are you truly maximizing the capabilities of GTM Server-Side by simply collecting "more" data into your systems?
No, because GTM Server-Side can be much more powerful than that: It's a data hub where first-party data can be enriched, transformed, and activated in real time to drive more intelligent business decisions.


Benefits
Data Control: GTM Server-Side allows you to control the flow of data between your website and third-party services, ensuring that you are compliant with data privacy regulations.
Privacy: GTM Server-Side can help you comply with data privacy regulations by ensuring that you are only collecting the data you need and that you are not sharing it with unauthorized third parties.
Security: 
  
- **Data Enrichment**: GTM Server-Side can be used to enrich your first-party data with third-party data, such as weather, location, or user behavior data.

Case studies mostly focus on how MORE data has been collected, but once you have established this, what is the next step to further optimize your setup?

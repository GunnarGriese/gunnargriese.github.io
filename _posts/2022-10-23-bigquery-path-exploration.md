The New Google Analytics (GA4) comes with a new Exploration feature, which allows GA users to deep-dive into their data — beyond the capabilities of the built-in standard reports. While the standard reports allow for monitoring key business metrics, the Exploration section makes advanced analytical techniques accessible to generate ad hoc insights quickly.

The analytical techniques available are the following:

- Free-form exploration
- Cohort exploration
- Funnel exploration
- Segment overlap
- User exploration
- User lifetime
- Path exploration

Check out the official Google [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/7579450?hl=en&ref_topic=9266525#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) for a more detailed introduction to GA4’s powerful Explorations feature.

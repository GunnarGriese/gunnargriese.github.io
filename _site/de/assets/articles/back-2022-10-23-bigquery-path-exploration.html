<p>The New Google Analytics (GA4) comes with a new Exploration feature, which allows GA users to deep-dive into their data — beyond the capabilities of the built-in standard reports. While the standard reports allow for monitoring key business metrics, the Exploration section makes advanced analytical techniques accessible to generate ad hoc insights quickly.</p>

<p>The analytical techniques available are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Free-form exploration</li>
  <li>Cohort exploration</li>
  <li>Funnel exploration</li>
  <li>Segment overlap</li>
  <li>User exploration</li>
  <li>User lifetime</li>
  <li>Path exploration</li>
</ul>

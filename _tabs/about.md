Hi, I'm Gunnar Griese, a self-employed Digital Analytics Consultant and Analytics Engineer dedicated to helping businesses harness the full potential of their data. With a strong background from leading digital analytics agencies in Germany (TRKKN) and Denmark (IIH Nordic), I specialize in Google Analytics (GA), Google Tag Manager (GTM), and the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). My proficiency in JavaScript, SQL, and Python allows me to optimize the Google tech stack, build custom solutions on top of it, and drive impactful results for my clients.

I also continue to teach "Technical Digital Analytics" at IHM Business School in Malm√∂, where I introduce students to the intricacies of GA and GTM. My personal website is a hub for insightful content that simplifies complex digital analytics, marketing strategies, web development, and cloud solutions.

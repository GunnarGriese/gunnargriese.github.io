Hi, I'm Gunnar Griese, a self-employed Digital Analytics Consultant and Analytics Engineer and member of 8-bit-sheep. I am dedicated to helping businesses harness the full potential of their data. With a strong background from the leading digital analytics agencies in Germany (TRKKN) and Denmark (IIH Nordic) consulting large enterprises and brands, I specialize in Google Analytics (GA) and Google Tag Manager (GTM). As a Google Cloud (GCP) Certified Professional Data Engineer I enjoy working with the GCP services to build scalable data pipelines and advanced analytics solutions. My proficiency in JavaScript, SQL, and Python allows me to optimize the Google tech stack, build custom solutions on top of it, and drive impactful results for my clients.

Now based in Copenhagen, I'm passionate about sharing my expertise with businesses of all sizes to help them activate their data efficiently. I also continue to teach "Technical Digital Analytics" at IHM Business School in Malm√∂, where I introduce students to the intricacies of GA and GTM. My personal website is a hub for insightful content that simplifies complex digital analytics, marketing strategies, web development, and cloud solutions.
